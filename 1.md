# Branch

`git branch`: list all the branch you have in your local machine

`git checkout -b <branch_name>`: Create a new branch

For example: `git checkout -b first-branch`

Push your branch for the first time:

`git push -u origin <branch_name>`

Later you can just do

`git push`

When you have premission deny, you need to ask for access right.

## Merge

1. Check which branch you crrent are

`git branch`

2. Checkout back to master branch

`git checkout master`

3. Pull the latest from master branch

`git pull origin master` or `git pull`

4. Back to your branch

`git checkout <branch_name>` or `git checkout -`

`git merge master`

`git push`

5. You can make a pull request then.

6. When you review other people's code,
   you can do `git pull` then `git checkout <other_branch_name>`

7. Check you history
   `git log` and use 'q' to exit
