# 1) create your own Branch and push the change remotely

`git branch`: list all the branch you have in your local machine

`git checkout -b <branch_name>`: Create a new branch

For example: `git checkout -b first-branch`

Push your branch for the first time:

`git push -u origin <branch_name>`

Later you can just do

`git push`

When you have premission deny, you need to ask for access right.

## Renaming Git Branch
Start by switching to the local branch which you want to rename: git checkout <old_name>

Rename the local branch by typing: git branch -m <new_name> ...

Push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch: git push origin -u <new_name>

## 2) pull and merge the latest change from master branch

1. Check which branch you crrent are

`git branch`

2. Checkout back to master branch

`git checkout master`

3. Pull the latest from master branch

`git pull origin master` or `git pull`

4. Back to your branch

`git checkout <branch_name>` or `git checkout -`

`git merge master`

## if there is conflict, then 
resolve it from pycharm

`git status`

`git add .`

`git commit -m <>`

`git push`

5. You can make a pull request then.

6. When you review other people's code,
   you can do `git pull` then `git checkout <other_branch_name>`

7. Check you history
   `git log` and use 'q' to exit
